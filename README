Wurst - wonderful universal remedial structure terminator

DESCRIPTION:
This program does sequence to sequence or structure alignments
and might do things like rank the consequent models.
The philosophy is that there is a set of low level routines
coded in C. These are called from perl. To do anything useful,
you write a little perl script which calls the functions you
want.
