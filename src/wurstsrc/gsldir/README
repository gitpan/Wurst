This code is taken from the GNU scientific software library and
is used mainly for integrating under the Gaussian's in the
probability calculations and maybe in the protein coordinate
superposition code.  Obviously, all this code is covered by the
authors' license (GPL).

It probably also means that the rest of our code has to be under
the same license.
